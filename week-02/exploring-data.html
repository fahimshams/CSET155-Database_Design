1. [ ] [Get Some Data](#script)
2. [ ] [Inspect It](#select)
3. [ ] [Sort It](#order_by)
4. [ ] [Filter It](#where)

name: script

# Get Some Data

To import any sql file, run this command:

```sh
$ psql postgres -f [SQL FILE NAME]
DROP DATABASE
CREATE DATABASE
You are now connected to database [TABLE NAME] as user "[USER NAME].
CREATE TABLE
INSERT 0 6
```

# Exploring Data

Today, we learn to interview our data and see what story it can tell us.

---
name: select
class: middle, center

# .eight[SELECT]

## Retrieves Records from one or more Tables

---

# Select Everything

```sql
SELECT * FROM teachers;
```
.fourteen[Retrieve all data in all columns from the teachers table]

- The .eight[&#42;] is a *wildcard*
- Here, it means "Every Column"
- .eight[FROM] specifies the table

---

# Select Certain Columns 

```sql
SELECT last_name, first_name, salary
FROM teachers;
```
.fourteen[Retrieve all data in these three columns in the teachers table]

- Separate the column names by commas
- These are the most basic usages of SELECT
- Helpful to get a quick glance at data

---
class: middle, center

For all of these queries, imagine our database has **thousands** or even **millions** of rows.

---

# Find Unique Values

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT school FROM teachers;
```
.fourteen[Retrieve each unique value in the school column.]

- .eight[DISTINCT] filters out duplicate values
- Helpful to find inconsistent data (typos, bad formatting, etc.)

---

# Find Unique Values

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT school, salary
FROM teachers;
```
.fourteen[Retrieve unique salaries from each unique school.]

- .eight[DISTINCT] can take multiple columns
- "For each *x* in the table, what are the *y* values?"
- Examples:
  - "For each venue, what bands are playing?"
  - "For each student, what courses are they taking?"

---
name: order_by

# .eight[ORDER BY]

## Sorts the Results according to one or more Fields

---

# Sorting Data

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary
FROM teachers ORDER BY salary DESC;
```
.fourteen[Retrieve all data in these three columns and sort by the highest salary]

- .eight[ORDER BY] doesn't change the table, only the query result
- Sorts in .eight[ASC] order by default, lowest to highest
- Can also be .eight[DESC], highest to lowest
- .eleven[Beware of sorting by text: 0 &lt; ? &lt; A &lt; _ &lt; a]

---

# Sorting Data

```sql
SELECT last_name, school, hire_date
FROM teachers
ORDER BY school ASC, hire_date DESC;
```
.fourteen[Retrieve all data in these columns, sorted by school, then by hire date]

- .eight[ORDER BY] can be used on any number of columns
- Most useful on only one or two

---
name: where

# .eight[WHERE]

## Filters the Results according to one or more Fields

---

# Limiting Data

```sql
SELECT last_name, school, hire_date
FROM teachers
WHERE school = 'Myers Middle School';
```
.eight[Retrieve only the data from these columns that match the criteria]

- .eight[WHERE] can find a specific value, a range, or multiple values depending on the .eight[operator]
- The .eight[WHERE] clause needs to follow the .eight[FROM] clause

---

# Comparison/Matching Operators

- WHERE school .eight[=] 'Baker Middle'
- WHERE school .eight[&lt;&gt;] 'Baker Middle'
  - or .eight[!=]
- WHERE salary .eight[&gt;] 20000
- WHERE salary .eight[&lt;] 60500
- WHERE salary .eight[&gt;].eight[=] 20000
- WHERE salary .eight[&lt;].eight[=] 60500

---

# Comparison/Matching Operators

- WHERE salary .eight[BETWEEN] 20000 .eight[AND] 40000
- WHERE last_name .eight[IN] ('Bush', 'Roush')
- WHERE first_name .eight[LIKE] 'Sam%'
- WHERE first_name .eight[ILIKE] 'sam%'
- WHERE first_name .eight[NOT] ILIKE 'sam%'

---
class: middle, center

# .eleven[Note:]

.eight[ILIKE] and .eight[!=] are Postgres only, not part of ANSI SQL.

---

# Practice:

- Use .eight[=] to find teachers named 'Janet'
- Use .eight[&lt;&gt;] to list schools excluding 'F.D. Roosevelt HS'
- Use .eight[&lt;] to list teachers hired before January 1, 2000
- Use .eight[&gt;].eight[=] to find teachers earning $43,500 or more
- Use .eight[BETWEEN] to find teachers with a salary between $40,000 and $65,000
  - Is it inclusive or exclusive?

---

# More with LIKE and ILIKE

```sql
LIKE 'b%'
LIKE '%ak%'
LIKE '_aker'
LIKE 'ba_er'
```
.fourteen[All of these would match the word 'baker']

- .eight[%] is a wildcard matching one or more characters
- .eight[_] is a wildcard matching one single character

---

# More with LIKE and ILIKE

- .eight[ILIKE] can be more helpful to make sure you don't exclude important data
- Performance on large databases can be slow, we'll fix this later

---

# Practice: 

```sql
SELECT first_name FROM teachers
WHERE first_name LIKE 'sam%';
```

```sql
SELECT first_name FROM teachers
WHERE first_name ILIKE 'sam%';
```

---

# Combining Operators

```sql
SELECT * FROM teachers
WHERE school = 'Myers Middle School'
      AND salary &lt; 40000;
```
```sql
SELECT * FROM teachers
WHERE last_name = 'Cole'
      OR last_name = 'Bush';
```

.eight[AND] and .eight[OR] can be combined any number of times

---

# Combining Operators

```sql
SELECT * FROM teachers
WHERE school = 'F.D. Roosevelt HS'
      AND (salary &lt; 38000 OR salary &gt; 40000);
```

Specify order of operations with parentheses

---

# Put It All Together

```sql
SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE criteria
ORDER BY column_names;
```
.eleven[This order is important!]

---

# Put It All Together

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, school, hire_date, salary
FROM teachers
WHERE school LIKE '%Roos%'
ORDER BY hire_date DESC;
```

---

# Exercises

Write queries for the following:
- Gets a list of teachers in each school, both sorted alphabetically by school name first then last name.
- Finds the teacher whose first name starts with 'S' and earns more than $40,000.
- Ranks teachers hired since January 1st, 2010, ordered by highest paid to lowest.
