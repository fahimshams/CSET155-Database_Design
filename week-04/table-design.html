name: case

# Case Conventions

- .eight[camelCase]
- .eight[PascalCase]
- .eight[snake_case]

Depends on your company. And if you choose one, stick with it!

---

# Case Conventions

Values in SQL are case insensitive.

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers;
CREATE TABLE Customers;
```

The second query will .eleven[fail] because that table already exists.

---

# Case Conventions

If you need case sensitivity, use quotes:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "Customers";
```

---

# Problems with Quotes

If you use quotes to create a case-sensitive table, you **always** have to use quotes to refer to it:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers;
SELECT * FROM Customers;
SELECT * FROM "Customers";
```
The first two queries are the same. 

---

# Problems with Quotes

You can also use quotes to escape reserved words and characters:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "CREATE TABLE";
```

name: rules

# Rules to Avoid Danger

1. Stick with snake_case names
2. Use proper names, not cryptic abbreviations
3. Watch out for length limits on names
4. Pluralize your table names
5. Use constraints!

---
name: constraints

# More on Constraints

- Rules created for a Table or a Column
- Defined in a .eight[CREATE] or .eight[ALTER TABLE] statement
- Checked on .eight[INSERT], .eight[UPDATE], .eight[DELETE], etc.

[You read the documentation, right?](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-constraints.html)

# More on Constraints

Table or Column Constraint?

- Data Types
- [Primary Key](#pk)
- [Foreign Key](#fk)
- [Unique](#unique)
- [Check](#check)
- [Not Null](#null)

---
name: pk

# Primary Keys: Natural

- Already exist, so no extra column is needed
- Already have meaning

Examples: License Plate, Book ISBN, Product SKU

---

# Primary Keys: Surrogate

- Intentionally don't have meaning
- Can save space depending on data type

Examples: Serial integers, UUID, or custom values

---

# Primary Keys: Syntax

.fourteen[Run Listing 7-1]

- Column constraint syntax in the first statement
- Table constraint syntax in the second

.fourteen[Run Listing 7-2 to see a key violation error]

What is the reason for the two different syntaxes?

---

# Primary Keys: Composite Keys

.fourteen[Run Listing 7-3]

- Table constraint syntax allows for comma-separated list
- Column constraint syntax is quicker and more readable for single column keys

.fourteen[Run Listing 7-4 to see another key violation error]

---

# Primary Keys: Surrogate Keys

- If there isn't a natural key, use a surrogate
- If you don't know which surrogate, use .eight[bigserial]

.fourteen[Listing 7-5 shows use of bigserial]

There are reasons to avoid auto-incrementing keys, but if you don't have problems, you have nothing to fix.

---
name: fk

# Foreign Keys: Syntax

Just like Primary Keys, Foreign Keys help maintain .eight[referential integrity].

.fourteen[Run Listing 7-6 one query at a time.]

How many keys do these tables have?

---

# Foreign Keys: Syntax

How many keys do these tables have?

1. First table has a natural primary key
2. Second table has a natural composite primary key
3. Second table has a foreign key

Did you get an error? Should you have?

---

# Foreign Keys: Cascading Delete

- Attempting to insert a reference that doesn't exist should fail.
- What about removing a reference already in use?

```sql
fk_col datatype REFERENCES tableB (pk_col) ON DELETE CASCADE
```

---
name: check

# Check

- Like PKs, can be column or table constraints
- Inserts must pass a logical expression:

```sql
age date CHECK (age &gt; '1900-01-01 00:00:00'),
```
```sql
CONSTRAINT grad_check CHECK (credits &gt;= 120 AND tuition = 'PAID')
```

.fourteen[Run Listing 7-7]

---
name: unique

# Unique

One difference between Primary Key and Unique: NULL

```sql
CONSTRAINT unique_users UNIQUE (username)
```

.fourteen[Run Listing 7-8 to see an example]

---
name: null

# Not Null

When you need values.

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
  ...
  quantity integer NOT NULL
);
```

.fourteen[Run Listing 7-9]

But you also might want to look at [default values](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-default.html).

---
name: alter

# Altering Tables

So you made a constraint and now you don't want to follow it:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP CONSTRAINT constraint_name;
```
Or
```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ALTER COLUMN col_name DROP NOT NULL;
```

.fourteen[Run Listing 7-10]

---

# Altering Tables

Quick note:

.eleven[You can only add a constraint if the data already follows it.]

Update the data first, then add your new rule.

---

# Great Debate on Constraints

- Business logic in the database?
- Business logic in the code?
- Both?

---
class: middle, center

# .eight[Who's ready to work with a million records?]

---
name: indexes

# Indexes

Speed up queries by using a shortcut, like indexes in books.

PostgreSQL offers a few types:

- Balanced-Tree Index
- Generalized Inverted Index
- Generalized Search Tree

Primary Keys and Unique constraints automatically create indexes.

---

# Indexes

1. Right click [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anthonydb/practical-sql/master/Chapter_07/city_of_new_york.csv) and save the CSV file
2. It's data for 940,374 addresses in New York City
3. Use .fourteen[Listing 7-11] to create the table and import the file
4. Verify it worked with a quick .eight[SELECT *] query
5. Use .fourteen[Listing 7-12] to run some benchmark queries

You should see a line with .eight[Execution time:] in the output. Record the time for each query.

---

# Indexes

Let's make it run a little faster:

```sql
CREATE INDEX street_idx ON new_york_addresses (street);
```

.eleven[Note: EXPLAIN and CREATE INDEX are Postgres-specific.]

1. Run this command and Postgres will build the index from the data
2. Now rerun the benchmark queries again and record their new times
3. Be amazed.

---

# Indexes

- Add size and maintenance costs
- Look at what kind of indexes exist on your DBMS
- Use indexes on columns you'll use in JOINs
- Use indexes on columns used in WHERE clauses
- Use EXPLAIN to test performance, just in case
