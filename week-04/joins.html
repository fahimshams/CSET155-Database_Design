# Basic Syntax

JOIN ... ON

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table_a JOIN table_b
ON table_a.primary_key = table_b.foreign_key;
```

Links one table to another by matching values contained in certain columns.

---
class: middle, center

# [Download the Code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anthonydb/practical-sql/master/Chapter_06/Chapter_06.sql)

Look at Listing 6-1

---
name: keys

# Key Columns

New SQL keywords:

- .eight[CONSTRAINT]
- .eight[PRIMARY KEY]
- .eight[UNIQUE]
- .eight[REFERENCES]

---

# Primary Key

Column or collection of columns whose values uniquely identify each row in a table.

- **Must** be unique
- **Can't** be missing

---

# Foreign Key

Reference to a primary key in another table that must already exist.

- **Can** be empty
- **Can** have duplicates in a table

---

# Constraints

- Rules you create that your table must follow
- Each rule has a name
- Define primary and foreign keys
- Learn more types later

---

# Constraints

Departments:
```sql
CONSTRAINT dept_key PRIMARY KEY (dept_id)
```

Employees:
```sql
dept_id integer REFERENCES departments (dept_id),
CONSTRAINT emp_key PRIMARY KEY (emp_id)
```

---

# Unique

- Not a key, but is a constraint
- Guarantees unique values or combinations of values

```sql
CONSTRAINT dept_city_unique UNIQUE (dept, city)
CONSTRAINT emp_dept_unique UNIQUE (emp_id, dept_id)  
```

---

# Run The Query

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees JOIN departments
ON employees.dept_id = departments.dept_id;
```

We've joined department data to the employee data on matching department IDs.

---
name: joins

# Types of Joins

- Inner Join
- Left Join
- Right Join
- Full Outer Join
- Cross Join

---

# Joins Defined By Example

```sql
CREATE TABLE schools_left (
  id integer CONSTRAINT left_id_key PRIMARY KEY,
  left_school varchar(30)
);
CREATE TABLE schools_right (
  id integer CONSTRAINT right_id_key PRIMARY KEY,
  right_school varchar(30)
);
```

Insert the data, see Listing 6-3.

---

# Inner Join

Get rows from both tables only on matches.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM schools_left JOIN schools_right
ON schools_left.id = schools_right.id;
```

Also .eight[INNER JOIN]

---

# Left Join

All rows from the left table plus matches from right.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM schools_left LEFT JOIN schools_right
ON schools_left.id = schools_right.id;
```

Unmatched rows on right are empty.

---

# Right Join

All rows from the right table plus matches from left.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM schools_left RIGHT JOIN schools_right
ON schools_left.id = schools_right.id;
```

Unmatched rows on left are empty.

---

# Full Outer Join

All rows from both tables, matches aligned.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM schools_left FULL OUTER JOIN schools_right
ON schools_left.id = schools_right.id;
```

Unmatched rows are empty on both sides.

---

# Cross Join

Every possible combination of rows from both tables.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM schools_left CROSS JOIN schools_right;
```

Cross Join doesn't care about matches, so it doesn't use the .eight[ON] keyword.

.eleven[Don't use Cross Join on large tables!!!]

---

# Which Join?

- Inner: most common; see matching data using well-structured database
- Left/Right: you want to see missing data; you know some won't match
- Full Outer: less common; visualize how two tables will merge
- Cross: rare; see all combinations

---
name: other

# Filtering By NULL

```sql
SELECT *
FROM schools_left LEFT JOIN schools_right
ON schools_left.id = schools_right.id
WHERE schools_right.id IS NULL;
```

Or the opposite using .eight[IS NOT NULL]

---

# Specifying Columns

Try this:

```sql
SELECT id
FROM schools_left LEFT JOIN schools_right
ON schools_left.id = schools_right.id;
```

Which .eight[id] are you going to get?

---

# Specifying Columns

```sql
SELECT schools_left.id,
       schools_left.left_school,
       schools_right.right_school
FROM schools_left LEFT JOIN schools_right
ON schools_left.id = schools_right.id;
```

When there's ambiguity, prepend the column name with the table name:

---

# Simplify With Aliases

```sql
SELECT lt.id,
       lt.left_school,
       rt.right_school
FROM schools_left AS lt LEFT JOIN schools_right AS rt
ON lt.id = rt.id;
```
The .eight[AS] keyword creates an alias you can use within the query.

---

# Joining Multiple Tables

Let's add two more tables to the mix:

- enrollment for each school
- grade levels taught in each school

Look at Listing 6-12 to create the tables and insert the data.

---

# Joining Multiple Tables

```sql
SELECT lt.id, lt.left_school, en.enrollment, gr.grades
FROM schools_left AS lt LEFT JOIN schools_enrollment AS en
    ON lt.id = en.id
LEFT JOIN schools_grades AS gr
    ON lt.id = gr.id;
```

---

# .fourteen[Exercises]

Look at Listing 6-13:

- Create a second US Counties table with census data from 2000
- Import data using the [CSV file here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anthonydb/practical-sql/master/Chapter_06/us_counties_2000.csv)
- Run the SELECT query.

.fourteen[What is it doing?]

---

# .fourteen[Exercises]

Which county had the greatest percentage loss of population between 2000 and 2010?

*Bonus points if you can figure out why.*

---

# .fourteen[Exercises]

The 2010 census data has 3,143 rows and the 2000 census data has 3,141. Using our knowledge of Joins and filtering by NULL, find out which counties don't exist in both tables.

For the curious, look each of them up online and see why they don't exist anymore, or why they were created.

---

# .fourteen[Exercises]

Go back to the Math lecture slides and look at the median problem.

Find the median of the percent change in county population from 2000 to 2010.
