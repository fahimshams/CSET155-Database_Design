name: sql

# Why SQL?

We've reviewed the keywords and syntax, but let's look at the big picture:

- Uses .eight[schemas] to enforce normalization.
- Keeps entity data .eight[distributed] across multiple tables.
- Allows .eight[relationships] between entities using joins and keys.

---

# Why SQL?

The benefits:

- .fourteen[You never have to worry about records not having fields.]
- .fourteen[You can think about one simple entity at a time.]
- .fourteen[You can still represent a complex mapping between related entities with rules to enforce them.]

---

# Why SQL?

The drawbacks:

- .eleven[Schemas aren't flexible.]
- .eleven[Simple entities require more relationships, making some things more complicated than they need to be.]
- .eleven[Distributed data in tables limits can lead to performance and scaling problems.]

name: normalization

# More on Normalization

Read up on the [formal rules for normalization.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization)

_Notice that satisfying the 1NF requires adding more tables when records can't be added without **altering** the table._

name: types

# Types of NoSQL

"Anything That Isn't SQL" isn't very descriptive...

- .eight[Document]: MongoDB, CouchDB, etc.
- .eight[Key-Value]: Redis, DynamoDB, etc.
- .eight[Graph]: OrientDB, Neo4j, etc.
- .eight[Wide-Column]: Cassandra, etc.
- .eight[Search]: Elasticsearch, etc.
