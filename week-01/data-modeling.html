# An Informal Data Modeling Process

1. Separate all the categories of data
  - .fourteen[What are the unique things?]

# Important Note

## .eight[Don't think about interfaces yet.]

A single web page might contain hundreds of entities of different types, or it could contain a fraction of attributes from a single entity.

---

# Interfaces

Imagine the entities found in

- A blogging site
- A social media app
- A weather app

---

# .fourteen[Lab: Data Modeling]

Choose a real application to data model in a new spreadsheet. Create a new sheet for each entity type, list its attributes in columns as headers, and fill out rows with at least four entities per type.
