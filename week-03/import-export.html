# Importing and Exporting Data

---
class: middle

# Agenda

1. [ ] [COPY Syntax](#copy)
2. [ ] [WITH Options](#with)
3. [ ] [Import](#import)
4. [ ] [Export](#export)

---
name: copy

# COPY Syntax

```sql
COPY table_name
FROM/TO 'path/to/file.csv'
WITH (options);
```

1. Choose between .eight[FROM] and .eight[TO]
2. Change the file path
3. Add your options

---
name: with

# WITH Options

- Format
- Header
- Delimiter
- Quote

---

# Format

Input and output formatting?

- CSV: most common format
- TEXT: more generic structure
- BINARY: series of bytes, least common

```sql
WITH (FORMAT CSV);
```

---

# Header

Is the data labeled?

```csv
FIRSTNAME,LASTNAME,LANGUAGES
Zach,Fedor,"JavaScript,Python"
```

If so, don't import first row as data!

```sql
WITH (FORMAT CSV, HEADER);
```

---

# Delimiter

What separates each piece of data?

- CSV defaults to comma
- TEXT defaults to tab
- Must be single character!
- Can't be carriage return, that means a new record!

```sql
WITH (FORMAT TEXT, DELIMITER '|');
```

---

# Quote

What specifies an ambiguous single value?

- Imagine "eggs, milk, bread" as one piece of data for grocery list column.
- Without quotes, it becomes three separate pieces of data.
- Default is double quote: .eight["]

```sql
WITH (FORMAT CSV, QUOTE '"');
```

---
name: import

# Import

```sql
COPY us_counties_2010
FROM 'path/to/us_counties_2010.csv'
WITH (FORMAT CSV, HEADER);
```

Using this table, import data from this csv file that
has a header line, using the rest of the default options.

---

# Import Subset Of Columns

```sql
COPY table_name (col_one, col_two)
FROM 'path/to/file.csv'
WITH (FORMAT CSV, HEADER);
```

Your table has more columns than your file, so what goes where?

---

# Import Default Values

This is tricky, but can be done by importing into a temporary table then copying again into the real table with any defaults.

---
name: export

# Export

```sql
COPY us_counties_2010
TO 'path/to/us_counties_2010_export.csv'
WITH (FORMAT CSV, HEADER);
```

Same as import, but using .eight[TO]. Only use .eight[.csv] file extension if it's truly a CSV format, otherwise use .eight[.txt].

---

# Export Subset Of Columns

```sql
COPY table_name (col_one, col_two)
TO 'path/to/file.txt'
WITH (FORMAT CSV, HEADER, DELIMITER '|');
```

Same as importing subset, but again using .eight[TO] and showing other valid options for .eight[WITH].

---

# Export Query Results!

```sql
COPY (
  SELECT geo_name, state_us_abbreviation
  FROM us_counties_2010
  WHERE geo_name ILIKE '%mill%'
)
TO 'path/to/export.csv'
WITH (FORMAT CSV, HEADER);
```
