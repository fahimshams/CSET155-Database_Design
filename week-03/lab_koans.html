    Lab: SQL Koans
  </h1>

  <hr>

  <p>
    <a href="https://sqlkoans.com/" target="_blank">Go here</a> to get the code and instructions.
  </p>

  <p>
    This git repo contains a Python program to help you learn SQL in a different environment. This is our first step to using SQL in our own programs. Read the instructions carefully to learn what you have to do fix the queries.
  </p>

  <p>
    The koans are grouped into categories called temples. You only have to work on <code>basics.sql</code> and <code>filtering.sql</code>. We will do the rest after learning relational data and joins.

  <h2>Things To Think About</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>This isn't using PostgreSQL. It's a different DBMS called SQLite. That means you can't use pgAdmin to view things, just the files of queries provided in the repo.</li>
    <li>The project still tries to stick to standard SQL syntax. You should know how to fix all the queries without having to learn any new syntax for SQLite.</li>
    <li>The author prefers an all lower-case convention without semi-colons. The former is preference, the latter might break code in other places. Still, it's good to see different conventions.</li>
  </ul>
