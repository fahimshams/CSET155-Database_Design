# Mathematical Operators

The usuals:
```sql
+ - * / %
```

- exponent: .eight[3 ^ 4]
- square root: .eight[|/ 9]
- cube root: .eight[||/ 27]
- factorial: .eight[4 !]

---

# SQL as a Calculator

```sql
SELECT 2 + 2;
SELECT 3 ^ 4;
SELECT 4 !;
SELECT (7 + 8) * 9;
```

---

# Math on Columns

```sql
SELECT qty,
       price,
       qty * price AS "Total Cost"
FROM purchases;
```

The .eight[AS] keyword gives us an alias to label a computed column.

---
name: types

# Working With Types

- two integers return an integer
- either as numeric returns a numeric
- anything with floating point returns a double precision
- exponent, factorial, and both root functions return numeric/floating-point even using integers

---

# Working With Types

```sql
SELECT 11 / 6;
```
This results in .eight[1], the remainder of .eight[5] gets removed to keep type as an integer.

```sql
SELECT 11.0 / 6;
SELECT CAST (11 AS numeric(3,1)) / 6;
```

# Examples

---

# Addition

```sql
SELECT geo_name,
       state_us_abbreviation AS "st",
       area_land + area_water AS "total_area"
FROM us_counties_2010
ORDER BY st ASC, total_area DESC;
```

---

# Subtraction

```sql
SELECT geo_name,
       state_us_abbreviation AS "st",
       p0010001 AS "Total",
       p0010003 + p0010004 + p0010005 + p0010006 + p0010007
           + p0010008 + p0010009 AS "All Races",
       (p0010003 + p0010004 + p0010005 + p0010006 + p0010007
           + p0010008 + p0010009) - p0010001 AS "Difference"
FROM us_counties_2010
ORDER BY "Difference" ASC;
```

---

# Percentage

```sql
SELECT geo_name,
       state_us_abbreviation AS "st",
       (CAST (p0010006 AS numeric(8,1)) / p0010001) * 100 AS "pct_asian"
FROM us_counties_2010
ORDER BY "pct_asian" DESC;
```

---
name: aggregate

# Aggregate Functions

- Previously, math was between columns for each record
- We can also calculate single value from all values in single column
- Examples: .eight[avg()] and .eight[sum()]

---

# Average

```sql
SELECT sum(p0010001) AS "County Sum",
       round(avg(p0010001), 0) AS "County Average"
FROM us_counties_2010;
```

---

# Median

```sql
SELECT sum(p0010001) AS "County Sum",
       round(avg(p0010001), 0) AS "County Average",
       percentile_cont(.5)
       WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY p0010001) AS "County Median"
FROM us_counties_2010;
```

---

# Average vs Median

- 98233 vs 25857
- Almost 40 counties have population over a million
- These high outliers skew averages
- Around 1570 counties have less than 25857 people
