# Advanced Queries

Subqueries can return values to be used in the main query.

```sql
UPDATE table
SET column = (SELECT column
              FROM table_b
              WHERE table.column = table_b.column)
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT column
              FROM table_b
              WHERE table.column = table_b.column);
```

---

# Advanced Queries

Show the counties with the top 10% of population.

```sql
SELECT geo_name, state_us_abbreviation, p0010001
FROM us_counties_2010
WHERE p0010001 &gt;= (
  SELECT percentile_cont(.9) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY p0010001)
  FROM us_counties_2010
  )
ORDER BY p0010001 DESC;
```

---

# Advanced Queries

Subqueries can also return **derived tables** that can be aliased and used in other queries, especially JOINs.

[Look at Listing 12-4](https://github.com/anthonydb/practical-sql/blob/master/Chapter_12/Chapter_12.sql#L46-L71)

---

# Advanced Queries

Also look into:

- Common Table Expressions
- Cross Tabulations
- Conditionals with the CASE statement

---
name: views

# Views, Functions, Triggers

- Save commonly run queries as views
- Program your own functions to reuse in queries*
- Automate actions with triggers that run on events

*You can even import and use Python!

---
name: search

# Text Search

Functions to Manipulate Strings:

- upper(), lower(), initcap()
- trim(), trailing trim()
- char_length()

Match Patterns with Regular Expressions!

---
name: types

# Fancy Data Types

More with Dates and Times:

- extract date parts
- create dates from parts
- conversion with timezones

GIS and Spatial Data:

- points, lines, polygons
- geography, geometry, well-known text
- shape intersections, unions, etc.

---
name: maintenance

# Maintenance Tools

You've planned and planted a beautiful garden. You never have to touch it again, right?

- Use tools like .eight[VACUUM] to clean up data
- Look into the .eight[postgres.conf] file to tweak settings
- Use the .eight[pg_ctl] CLI tool to manage the DBMS
- Save frequent backups with .eight[pg_dump] or restore from a back up with .eight[pg_restore]

---
name: scaling

# Scaling Up

Once you get more data than you can handle, look into these terms:

- [Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling](https://hackernoon.com/database-scaling-horizontal-and-vertical-scaling-85edd2fd9944)
- [Sharding](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-database-sharding)
- [The CAP Theorem](https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/)

The End.
