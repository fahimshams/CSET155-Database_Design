name: psql

#  Using psql

PostgreSQL provides the .eight[psql] program to manage your databases from the command line.

```bash
$ psql --version
psql (PostgreSQL) 12.1
$ man psql
```

---

# Using psql

Just like the Query Tool in pgAdmin, you need to open a connection to a specific database:

```bash
$ psql analysis
psql (12.1)
Type "help" for help.

analysis=#
```

Now you're in a REPL!

---

# Using psql

Check the man page for other options:

- Connect as different user
- Connect to a remote server
- Or performing some single action instead of opening a REPL

---

# Using psql

Note on the database user:

- .eight[#] at the end of the prompt for .eight[superusers]
- .eight[&gt;] at the end of the prompt for non superusers

[Read the docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/user-manag.html) to see what users and roles are for.

---
name: commands

# Meta-Commands

In the REPL, you can use .eight[meta-commands] preceded by a backslash to interact with psql.

```bash
=# \?
=# \h [keyword]
```

The first lists all the meta-commands and the second gives you help on SQL keywords.

---

# Meta-Commands

Some notable commands:

- .eight[\c [database]] connects you to a new database
- .eight[\l] lists all databases
- .eight[\dt] lists all tables in the database
- add .eight[+] to see more details like size

---
name: queries

# Running Queries

You can run any valid SQL query in the REPL.

```sql
=# SELECT * FROM employees;
```

---

# Running Queries

Format your query correctly:

- Hitting .eight[enter] can split your query on new lines.
- Your query will only run if you end it with a semicolon!
- The prompt changes from .eight[=#] to .eight[(#] to show unclosed parens.
- Hit .eight[CTRL-C] to cancel a query and get back to the prompt.
- Hit .eight[CTRL-D] to quit psql.
- Use tab completion to help you out!

---
name: format

# Formatting Results

- Small result sets are printed below your query
- Larger results are piped to .eight[less]

---

# Formatting Results

For tables with many columns, use the expanded view command to see results as a vertical block.

```sql
=# SELECT * FROM employees;
=# \x
=# SELECT * FROM employees;
```

---

# Formatting Results

You can use the .eight[\pset] command to set variables to change the format:

- .eight[border <int>] to see different border options
- .eight[format unaligned] to see delimited lines, not columns

[Read the docs for pset](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html) to see more options

---
name: output

# Saving Output

As always, you can use the .eight[COPY] keyword to import and export using a query. There's a .eight[\copy] command to do the same thing.

---

# Saving Output

You can use the .eight[\o] command to save results directly to a file.

```sql
=# SELECT * FROM employees;
=# \o '/absolute/path/to/file'
=# SELECT * FROM employees;
```

.eleven[Don't accidentally overwrite a file you need!]

---

# .fourteen[Practice Using the CLI]

Go through some of the other slides and see if you can complete them using .eight[psql] instead of .eight[pgAdmin]. It's good review!
