# USDA Food Inspection Directory

This isn't the biggest or most complicated database you've seen, but it definitely has the dirtiest data.

- Download the [CSV file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anthonydb/practical-sql/master/Chapter_09/MPI_Directory_by_Establishment_Name.csv)
- Use .fourteen[Listing 9-1] to create and import the table.
- For practice, use the .eight[count(*)] function in a query to make sure there are .eight[6,287] rows.

# Interviewing Data

Think of this like a job interview:

- What all does the data hold?
- What is it good at?
- What questions can it answer?
- How clean is it?

These are important things to know before we do any analysis, and aggregate functions can help.

---

For example, we might assume that each company in each row operates at its own address. .fourteen[Is that true?]

```sql
SELECT company,
       street,
       city,
       st,
       count(*) AS address_count
FROM meat_poultry_egg_inspect
GROUP BY company, street, city, st
HAVING count(*) &gt; 1
ORDER BY company, street, city, st;
```

---

We can also check for missing values. For example, how many of these companies are in each state?

```sql
SELECT st, 
       count(*) AS st_count
FROM meat_poultry_egg_inspect
GROUP BY st
ORDER BY st;
```
.fourteen[Why are there more than 50 rows?]

---

Our last query had .eight[null] values in the state column, which probably isn't good. Let's find them and see how we should fix them.

```sql
SELECT est_number,
       company,
       city,
       st,
       zip
FROM meat_poultry_egg_inspect
WHERE st IS NULL;
```

---

Even if data isn't missing, it can be inconsistent. Let's see how many company names are misspelled: 

```sql
SELECT company,
       count(*) AS company_count
FROM meat_poultry_egg_inspect
GROUP BY company
ORDER BY company ASC;
```

---

We can also look for malformed data, values that we know shouldn't be able to exist. For example, we know zip codes should only be five digits:

```sql
SELECT length(zip),
       count(*) AS length_count
FROM meat_poultry_egg_inspect
GROUP BY length(zip)
ORDER BY length(zip) ASC;
```

---

Looks like leading zeros got stripped from the beginning of our numbers, but let's double check.

```sql
SELECT st,
       count(*) AS st_count
FROM meat_poultry_egg_inspect
WHERE length(zip) &lt; 5
GROUP BY st
ORDER BY st ASC;
```
All of them come from states in the northeast, where zip codes start with zero.

---

# Things to Fix

We found a nice little list so far:

- Missing values in the state column
- Inconsistent spelling of company names
- Inaccurate zip codes from the file conversion

---

# Modifying Tables and Columns

Add a column:
```sql
ALTER TABLE table ADD COLUMN column data_type;
```

Remove a column:
```sql
ALTER TABLE table DROP COLUMN column;
```

---

Change a column's data type:
```sql
ALTER TABLE table ALTER COLUMN column SET DATA TYPE data_type;
```

Add a NOT NULL constraint to a column:
```sql
ALTER TABLE table ALTER COLUMN column SET NOT NULL;
```

Remove a NOT NULL constraint:
```sql
ALTER TABLE table ALTER COLUMN column DROP NOT NULL;
```

---
name: update

# Modifying Values

```sql
UPDATE table SET column = value;
```
This is the basic form, but isn't that helpful. It changes every value of every record. Try this instead:

```sql
UPDATE table SET column = value
WHERE criteria;
```

---

You can change multiple values at once with:

```sql
UPDATE table
SET column1 = value1,
    column2 = value2;
```

---

And you can use sub-queries to use values from other tables:

```sql
UPDATE table
SET column = table_b.column
FROM table_b
WHERE table.column = table_b.column;
```

---
name: backup

# Backups

Let's make a backup of the data in case we screw anything up:

```sql
CREATE TABLE meat_poultry_egg_inspect_backup AS
SELECT * FROM meat_poultry_egg_inspect;
```

---

# .fourteen[Exercises]

Earlier, we learned that three rows don't have a value in their .eight[st] column. Find the rows, then use their zip codes to figure out what state they're in.

Use an UPDATE query to fix the rows.
